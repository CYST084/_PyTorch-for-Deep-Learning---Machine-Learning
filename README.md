## PyTorch for Deep Learning & Machine Learning

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks implementing concepts and exercises *(mostly from PyTorch for Deep Learning course by Daniel Bourke)*. The notebooks offer a practical and interactive approach to mastering PyTorch for various deep learning tasks.

**Topics Covered:**

- **PyTorch Fundamentals:** Dive into tensors, tensor operations, and automatic differentiation – the building blocks of deep learning with PyTorch.
- **Neural Networks:** Building neural networks from scratch, understanding layers and activation functions
- **Image Classification:** Working with convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the powerhouse behind image recognition, training your own image classifiers
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Exploring recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and other NLP techniques
- **Model Training and Evaluation:** Grasp the essentials of Optimizers, loss functions, training loops and evaluating model performance.
- **Advanced Concepts:** Go beyond the basics with Transfer learning, model deployment, and more.. 

- Neural network training
- Advanced deep learning concepts

**Requirements:**

**Option 1: Local Machine Setup**

* **Python 3.x:** Verify your version by running `python --version` in your terminal. If you don't have Python 3, download it from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
* **PyTorch:** Follow the installation instructions: [https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).
* **NumPy:** Install NumPy using `pip install numpy` in your terminal.
* **Matplotlib:** Install Matplotlib using `pip install matplotlib` in your terminal.

**Option 2: Google Colab**

1. Visit [https://colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com).
2. This environment already includes Python, PyTorch, NumPy, and Matplotlib. No local installation is required.
3. Upload the contents of this repository to your Colab notebook for execution.

**Usage:**
**Choose Your Environment:**

1. **Google Colab:** Upload the repository's contents to a new Colab notebook.
2. **VS Code with Jupyter Notebook:** Clone the repository, open it in VS Code, and double-click on a `.ipynb` file to run.
3. **Jupyter Notebook:** 
   - Navigate to the repository's directory in your terminal.
   - Run `jupyter notebook`. This will open the Jupyter Notebook interface in your browser. 
   - Open and run the notebooks (`.ipynb` files).

**To run the notebooks, double-click on each `.ipynb` file in your chosen environment.**
