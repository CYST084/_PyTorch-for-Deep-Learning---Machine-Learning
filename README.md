## PyTorch for Deep Learning & Machine Learning

**What it's About:**

This repository provides a reimplementation of concepts learned from the PyTorch for Deep Learning & Machine Learning course (likely inspired by resources like [David Bourke's 
 Course - learnpytorch.io](https://www.learnpytorch.io/). 

It offers a practical exploration of PyTorch functionalities through Notebooks.

**You'll learn PyTorch fundamentals and proceed to advanced DL concepts, training neural nets... etc.**

**Requirements:**

- Python 3.x (check with `python --version` in your terminal)
- PyTorch (installation instructions: [https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/))
- NumPy
- MatPlotLib

**Usage:**

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CYST084/_PyTorch-for-Deep-Learning---Machine-Learning.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd _PyTorch-for-Deep-Learning---Machine-Learning
   ```

3. **Launch Notebook:**
   - Jupyter notebooks, ipython kernels (eg in vs code), Google colab or Kaggle Notebooks will do just fine

5. **Explore the notebooks:**

   Navigate to the directory containing the notebooks and double-click on each one to run them.
