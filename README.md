## PyTorch for Deep Learning & Machine Learning

**What it's About:**

This repository provides a reimplementation of concepts learned from the PyTorch for Deep Learning & Machine Learning course (likely inspired by resources like [https://www.learnpytorch.io/](https://www.learnpytorch.io/) or similar tutorials). It offers a practical exploration of PyTorch functionalities through Jupyter Notebooks.

**Requirements:**

- Python 3.x (check with `python --version` in your terminal)
- PyTorch (installation instructions: [https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/))
- Jupyter Notebook (installation instructions: [https://jupyter.org/install](https://jupyter.org/install))

**Usage:**

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd <your-repo-name>
   ```

3. **Launch Notebook:**
   - Jupyter notebooks, ipython kernels (eg in vs code), Google colab or Kaggle Notebooks will do just fine

5. **Explore the notebooks:**

   Navigate to the directory containing the notebooks and double-click on each one to run them.
