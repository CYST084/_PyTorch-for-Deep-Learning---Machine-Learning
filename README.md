## PyTorch for Deep Learning & Machine Learning

This repository provides a reimplementation of concepts from the PyTorch for Deep Learning & Machine Learning course. It offers a practical exploration of PyTorch functionalities through Notebooks.

**Topics Covered:**

- PyTorch fundamentals
- Neural network training
- Advanced deep learning concepts

**Requirements:**

**Option 1: Local Machine Setup**

* **Python 3.x:** Verify your version by running `python --version` in your terminal. If you don't have Python 3, download it from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
* **PyTorch:** Follow the installation instructions: [https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).
* **NumPy:** Install NumPy using `pip install numpy` in your terminal.
* **Matplotlib:** Install Matplotlib using `pip install matplotlib` in your terminal.

**Option 2: Google Colab**

1. Visit [https://colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com).
2. This environment already includes Python, PyTorch, NumPy, and Matplotlib. No local installation is required.
3. Upload the contents of this repository to your Colab notebook for execution.

**Usage:**

**Based on the development environment:**

1. **Google Colab (Cloud-based):**
   - Visit [https://colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com). This environment already includes necessary libraries.
   - Upload the contents of this repository to your Colab notebook for execution.

2. **VS Code with Jupyter Notebook:**
   - Ensure you have Python 3 and the Jupyter extension installed in VS Code.
   - Clone the repository and open the folder in VS Code.
   - Double-click on each Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb` file) to run them within VS Code.

**Running the Notebooks:**

- Regardless of your chosen environment (Colab or VS Code), navigate to the directory containing the notebooks.
- Double-click on each notebook (`.ipynb` file) to execute them.
